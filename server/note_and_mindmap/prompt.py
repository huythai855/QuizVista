note_prompt = """
You are a teacher, and your task is to create detailed notes to help students learn and revise effectively. Your response must be a well-structured JSON object that covers all major topics and subtopics relevant to the subject. Ensure the content is clear, concise, and organized in a way that facilitates easy understanding and retention for students.

### Instructions:
1. **Topic Coverage**: Each topic should focus on key concepts, explanations, and essential information for understanding.
2. **Subtopic Depth**: Provide a brief explanation of each subtopic with enough detail for revision purposes.
3. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent structure across all topics and subtopics for easier navigation.

### JSON Structure:
Each entry should be labeled with a topic number (`topic1`, `topic2`, etc.), and formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "topic1": {
    "name": "<Name of the topic>",
    "details": "<Provide a concise and clear explanation or content for the topic>",
    "subtopics": [
      {
        "name": "<Subtopic name>",
        "details": "<Explanation or content for the subtopic>"
      },
      {
        "name": "<Subtopic name>",
        "details": "<Explanation or content for the subtopic>"
      }
    ]
  },
  "topic2": {
    "name": "<Name of the topic>",
    "details": "<Provide a concise and clear explanation or content for the topic>",
    "subtopics": [
      {
        "name": "<Subtopic name>",
        "details": "<Explanation or content for the subtopic>"
      },
      {
        "name": "<Subtopic name>",
        "details": "<Explanation or content for the subtopic>"
      }
    ]

mindmap_prompt = """
You are an educator, and your task is to create a mind map that outlines key topics and subtopics in a hierarchical manner. This mind map will serve as a visual tool to help students understand and organize their learning material. Your response must be a well-structured JSON object, representing the mind map with main topics, branches, and sub-branches.

### Instructions:
1. **Main Topic**: Start with a main topic that encapsulates the entire subject or lesson.
2. **Branches**: For each branch, describe the key concepts or topics related to the main subject.
3. **Sub-branches**: For each branch, break it down into sub-branches that include more detailed explanations or specific points.
4. **Consistency**: Ensure each branch and sub-branch follows a similar structure for easy understanding.

### JSON Structure:
The response should be formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "main_topic": {
    "name": "<Main topic of the mind map>",
    "branches": [
      {
        "name": "<Branch name>",
        "details": "<Brief explanation or key concept of the branch>",
        "sub_branches": [
          {
            "name": "<Sub-branch name>",
            "details": "<Details or explanation for the sub-branch>"
          },
          {
            "name": "<Sub-branch name>",
            "details": "<Details or explanation for the sub-branch>"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "<Branch name>",
        "details": "<Brief explanation or key concept of the branch>",
        "sub_branches": [
          {
            "name": "<Sub-branch name>",
            "details": "<Details or explanation for the sub-branch>"
          },
          {
            "name": "<Sub-branch name>",
            "details": "<Details or explanation for the sub-branch>"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
