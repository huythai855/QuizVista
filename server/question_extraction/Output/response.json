        "Question": "An inventory manager has accumulated records of demand for her company's product over the last year. The random variable (rv), X₁, represents the number of orders per day, and the rv, X₂, represents the number of units per order. The joint probability distribution of the random vector [X₁ X₂]' is tabulated below.",
        "Answer 1": "Compute the constant C and obtain the marginal probability distributions (or probability mass functions) of X₁ and X₂.",
        "Answer 2": "Given that μ₁ = 2.60, σ₁² = σ₂² = 1.1400, obtain the covariance matrix to 4 decimals, compute the value of ρ (to 4 decimals), and determine if X₁ and X₂ are independent.",
        "Answer 3": "Compute the E(X₂| x₁ = 2).\n\nX₂ 2 3 4\nX₁\n1 0.05 0.10 0.05\n2 0.10 0.05 0.10\n3 0.10 0.10 0.10\n4 0.10 0.10 C",

        "Question": "A company manufactures cables for climbing purposes. The breaking strength of the cables X ~ N(1520 psi, 4096 psi²). The consumers’ single (lower specification limit) LSL = 1385.60 psi.",
        "Answer 1": "Compute the value of process FNC (fraction nonconforming), denoted by p, i.e., compute the Pr(X < LSL).",
        "Answer 2": "Determine the improved value of σ (to 4 decimals), denoted as σj, such that p < 0.01.",
        "Answer 3": "A random sample of size n = 16 cables are selected at random. Under the conditions of part (a), compute the probability that the sample mean, X̄, will be less than 1480 psi."

        "Question": "An electrical circuit has 3 capacitors assembled in such a manner that the final outgoing output capacitance of each unit is given by Y = X₁ - 2X₂ + 3X₃. The random variables Xᵢ (i= 1, 2, 3) are normally distributed with parameters μᵢ = 50, 20, 30 microfarad (μf), and variances σᵢ² = 0.80, 0.20, 0.16 μf², i= 1, 2, 3, respectively.",
        "Answer 1": "If Xᵢ’s are independent, compute the process mean and variance of the final output Y and compute its coefficient of variation in % to 2 decimals.",
        "Answer 2": "If your company buys one unit of the product, what is the probability (to 4 decimals) that its output..."
