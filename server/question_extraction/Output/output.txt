1(30 Points). An inventory manager has accumulated records of demand
for her company's certain product over the last year. The rv, Xi, represents the
number orders per day and the rv, X2, represents the number of units per order.
The joint probability (Pr) distribution of the random vector [X; __X2]' is tabulated
below. (a) Compute the constant C and obtain the marginal PDs (or pmfs) of X,

and X,. (b) Given that p1; = 2.60, 01, = o?= 1.1400, obtain the covariance matrix
2 to 4 decimals, compute the value of p (to 4 decimals), and determine if X, and

X, are independent. (c) Compute the E(X2| x: = 2).

2(30 Points). A company manufactures cables for climbing purposes.
The breaking strength of the cables X ~ N(1520 psi, 4096 psi?). The consumers’
single (lower specification limit) LSL = 1385.60 psi. (a) Compute the value of
process FNC (fraction nonconforming), denoted by p, i.e., compute the Pr(X <
LSL). (b) Determine the improved value of 6 (to 4 decimals), denoted as oj, such
that p< 0.01. (c) A random sample of size n = 16 cables are selected at random.

Under the conditions of part (a), compute the Pr that the sample mean, X, will be
less than 1480 psi.

3(30 Points). An electrical circuit has 3 capacitors assembled in such a
manner that the final outgoing output capacitance of each unit is given by
Y = Xi- 2X. + 3X3.

The rvs X; (i= 1, 2, 3) are normally distributed with parameters 4; = 50, 20, 30

microfarad (if), and variances 6,7 = 0.80, 0.20, 0.16 uf” , i= 1, 2, 3, respectively. (a)

If X;’ are independent, compute the process mean and variance of the final output Y

and compute its coefficient of variation in % to 2 decimals.. (b) If your company

buys one unit of the product, what is the Pr (to 4 decimals) that its output
